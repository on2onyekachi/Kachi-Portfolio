# Kachi Portfolio

A clean, responsive, and professional frontend developer portfolio built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — with support for **dark mode**, **Netlify form handling**, and smooth animations.

## 📌 About This Project

This is my updated portfolio site, designed to reflect my current frontend skills and developer personality. It introduces who I am, showcases a few of my best projects, and provides a way for people to contact or hire me.  

I built it from scratch without frameworks, using custom layout and styling, to stay in full control of the responsiveness, animation, and user experience.

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is live and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
You can view it here → [Live Preview](https://on2onyekachi.github.io/Kachi-Portfolio)
